Dear [Customer Name],

Notification of changes to your current account terms and conditions

We are writing to inform you of important changes to the terms and conditions of your [Account Name] with Lloyds Bank (account number: [XXXXXX]). These changes will take effect on [Effective Date], in accordance with clause [X] of your current account agreement and in line with our obligations under the Payment Services Regulations 2017.

Summary of changes

From [Effective Date], we are:
- Changing the way we calculate overdraft interest: Interest will be calculated using a daily rate based on the end-of-day balance, rather than on the average monthly balance.
- Revising the fees associated with unpaid transactions: The fee for returning an unpaid Direct Debit or standing order will increase from 5 GBP to 7.50 GBP.
- Updating your rights to cancel certain transactions: You will now be able to cancel a future-dated payment up until 11.59pm the day before it is due to be processed.

Full details of the changes and an updated copy of the terms and conditions are enclosed with this letter.

Why this is happening

We are making these changes to ensure our account structure remains compliant with updated industry guidance and to improve the transparency of our fee and interest structures.

What you need to do

You do not need to take any action if you are happy with the changes. However, if you do not accept the updated terms, you have the right to close your account without charge before the changes take effect.

If you continue to use your account after the changes come into effect, you will be deemed to have accepted the new terms.
