Dear [Customer Name],

Simple ways to stay on top of your everyday finances

At Lloyds Bank, we are here to support you not just with banking, but with helpful tools and tips to make managing your money easier.

Here are a few features you might not have tried yet - all available in your online banking or mobile app:

Set your own spending limits
Stay in control by setting weekly or monthly spending caps across categories like groceries, entertainment, or travel.

Get real-time alerts
Choose to receive notifications when your balance drops below a certain amount or when payments leave your account - helping you avoid surprises.

Track your savings goals
Set up a personalised goal and watch your progress, whether you are saving for a holiday, a rainy day, or just a bit of extra peace of mind.
